# LoL Account Checker-PuppyLover101's Version!

## What's the difference between this LoL Acc Checker and other ones?

Well, this LoL Acc Checker is based of the original account checker (https://github.com/madk/LoLAccountChecker), but is modified to my suiting =) I've made it more detailed (check below), it has faster performance, and has no bugs! If you do find a bug, be sure to notify me and I'll fix it ASAP!

*This account checker will also be updated by me every League Patch, and it will also get updates for new champions, skins, regions, runes, etc.*

This program is Made by a person who has bad internet, and is made for people who have bad internet aswell. This account checker is very network and pc conserving; **However, it is ultra-fast aswell.**
